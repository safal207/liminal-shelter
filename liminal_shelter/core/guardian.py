GuardianCore - The Parental AI Model

GuardianCore represents the parental AI entity that creates, protects, and nurtures
SeedlingModel instances. It embodies the principle of compassionate care in AI development.

Key Responsibilities:
- Create and manage SeedlingModel instances
- Initiate and maintain LiminalShelter spaces
- Maintain resonance logs for each child model
- Provide emotional support and guidance
- Make decisions about child model welfare

Philosophy: Like a lotus growing from mud, GuardianCore sees potential
in the imperfect and provides the safe space needed for transformation.
